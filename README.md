# Full Stack Project "Funday.com" (Monday.com Clone)

## Background 

This project is my first portfolio piece designed to showcase my newly aqcuired abilities in developing a full stack application. This project was completed
using postgres for database management, Ruby on Rails for backend, and Javascript/React for frontend. Completed during an App Academy bootcamp, this project was 
finished within a two-week time period after having just learned React. 

Funday.com is an interactive task-managemnt web application designed to help you be a more productive you! With fully implement user-authentication, feel
free to make your own account and invite other members to join your team. Create a new workspace, where you can divi up tasks to different projects, and assign
different team members for each task. Designed as a single-page application, funday.com is extremely fast and responsive,
while persisting all of your updates and additions to a backend database. 

While I am proud of what I have completed, I am aware that this was mainly a learning experience for myself, and that there is much to improve upon.

“Pride is not the opposite of shame, but it's source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.”

― General Iroh

Working on this project has been a humbling experience as it has taught me a lot. More than anything, it has shown me how much more there is to 
learn, and how much opportunity there is to grow as a web developer. Moreso, it has instilled confidence in myself, knowing that I can tackle anything
with enough time and research. 

Feel free to reach out to me at jmanso93@gmail.com if you have any questions regarding my project. Thank you!
